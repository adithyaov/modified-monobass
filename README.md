This template is based on [Monobass](http://basscss.com/themes/monobass/) and is
naturally named Modified Monobass.

This is an experimental template and is somewhat functional on all screen
sizes. I've made it for personal use and being a minimalist the design is very
simple. One could even associate the word naive with it.

No restrictions are imposed on the usage of this template.
